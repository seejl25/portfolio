# portfolio
Made my own portfolio webpage with a short description of myself and projects that I have developed.
- Most up-to-date profile for myself as I am constantly learning and building new projects daily
- Mainly used HTML and CSS for content and styling of the webpage
- JS functions used to add in descriptions of the project
- Consist of two parts: the cover page and the homepage.
- Homepage consists of a short description of myself and projects that I have done

Below is a mockup of the webpage
